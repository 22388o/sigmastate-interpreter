\section{Typing}
\label{sec:typing}

\langname is a strictly typed language, in which every term should have a
type in order to be wellformed and evaluated. Typing judgement of the form
$\Der{\Gamma}{e : T}$ say that $e$ is a term of type $T$ in the typing
context $\Gamma$.

Note that each well-typed term has exactly one type hence we assume there
exists a funcion $termType: Term \to \mathcal{T}$ which relates each well-typed
term with the corresponding type.
