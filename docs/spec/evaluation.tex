\section{Evaluation Semantics}
\label{sec:evaluation}

Here we specifiy evaluation semantics of \langname in terms of reduction of
its terms to values in a given data environment. To do that we specify
\emph{reduction context} $\Ctx$ - a tree-like structure with the hole, which
marks the position of \emph{redex} to be evaluated. And using contexts we
specify \emph{evaluation relation} which defines transformation of redexes
into irreducible values.

The main property of $\Ctx$ is that for any term $t$ there exists a unique
decompostion of $t$ into redex $r$ and context $\Ctx$ such that $t =
[r]\Ctx$, i.e. substitution of redex in the hole of the context gives the
decomposed term $t$. \mnote{This needs to be proved}

The standard call-by-value evaluation semantics of the core language, which
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:semantics}, doesn't use reified types.
