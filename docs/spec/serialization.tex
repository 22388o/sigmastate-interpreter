\section{Serialization}
\label{sec:serialization}

Terms of the language described in Section~\ref{sec:language} can be
serialized to array of bytes to be stored in Ergo blockchain (e.g. as
Box.propositionBytes).

When the guarding script of an input box of a transaction is validated the \lst{propositionBytes} array is deserialized to an \langname term, which can be evaluated as it is specified in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

Here we specify the serialization procedure and the format of \langname terms and types.
