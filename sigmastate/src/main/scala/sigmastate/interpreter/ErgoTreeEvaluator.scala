/** Implements a simple and fast direct-style interpreter of ErgoTrees.
  *
  * ### Motivation
  * [[ErgoTree]] is a simple declarative intermediate representation for Ergo contracts. It is
  * designed to be compact in serialized form and directly executable, i.e. no additional
  * transformation is necessary before it can be efficiently executed.
  *
  * This class implements a big-step recursive interpreter that works directly with
  * ErgoTree HOAS. Because of this the evaluator is very simple and follows denotational
  * semantics of ErgoTree (see https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf). Or, the other
  * way around, this implementation of ErgoTreeEvaluator is purely functional with
  * immutable data structures and can be used as definition of ErgoTree's semantics.
  *
  * ### Implementation
  * ErgoTreeEvaluator takes ErgoTree directly as it is deserialized as part of a
  * transaction. No additional transformation is performed.
  * ErgoTree is interpreted directly and all the intermediate data is stored in the
  * runtime types.
  * The runtime types are such types as [[special.collection.Coll]],
  * [[special.sigma.SigmaProp]], [[special.sigma.AvlTree]], [[BigInt]], etc.
  * It also use immutable Map to keep current [[DataEnv]] of computed [[ValDef]]s, as
  * result only addition is used from the map, and deletion is essentially a garbage
  * collection.
  *
  * ### Performance
  * Since this interpreter directly works with SigmaDsl types (Coll, BigInt, SigmaProp
  * etc), it turns out to be very fast. Since it also does JIT style costing instead of
  * AOT style, it is 5-6x faster than existing implementation.
  *
  * @param context   Represents blockchain data context for ErgoTree evaluation
  * @param constants Segregated constants from ErgoTree, to lookup them from
  *                  [[ConstantPlaceholder]] evaluation.
  * @param coster    Accumulates computation costs.
  * @param profiler  Performs operations profiling and time measurements (if enabled in settings).
  * @param settings  Settings to be used during evaluation.
